    "Human eyes can see an object as dimmest as magnitude 6(Snyder). With telescopes, more stars and planets become observable. However, this direct method has its limitation. It relies on the distance and the apparent magnitude. Transit and Doppler, as indirect methods, can expand the horizon.\n",

    "The data project will guide students to apply transit and Dopper methods. Students will infer the existence of stars, period, semi-major axis, total mass, each mass and radii of stars, and temperature ratios by analyzing the transit light curves and radial velocities.\n",

    "Our estimation is a simplified version. We assume the system is flat towards us. However, such probability is low. So our approximation is not that reasonable without considering the inclination.\n",

    "Uncertainty is important factor for measurements as it indicates a range of accuracy. The uncertainty of radial velocity may affect the most of our results, since relationship of mass~a~v^3. Others are around the same factor or less as mass.\n",
