You will read in values for $r$, $\\rho$, $P$, and $T$ that were derived from a full stellar model, and see how well we are able to reproduce the full stellar model with a simple approximation for the density. \n",

Be sure to set unpack = True. Most error messages stem from incorrect mapping of parameters to columns, or an incorrect number of rows at the top of the file to skip. (Other issues include unclosed brackets and the like, so check your lines carefully!)\n",
